# Classful Addressing: A Brief Introduction

- Classful addressing is an early method of allocating IP addresses based on predefined classes. 
- Introduced in the original design of the Internet Protocol (IP), it divides the entire IP address space into five distinct classes (A, B, C, D, and E) based on the value of the first octet. 
- This approach was primarily used before the advent of Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR), which offers more efficient use of IP addresses.

### Key Features of Classful Addressing:

1. **IP Classes**:
   - **Class A**: 
     - **Range**: 1.0.0.0 to 126.255.255.255
     - **Default Subnet Mask**: 255.0.0.0 (/8)
     - **Usable Hosts**: Approximately 16 million.
   - **Class B**: 
     - **Range**: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255
     - **Default Subnet Mask**: 255.255.0.0 (/16)
     - **Usable Hosts**: Approximately 65,000.
   - **Class C**: 
     - **Range**: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255
     - **Default Subnet Mask**: 255.255.255.0 (/24)
     - **Usable Hosts**: 254.
   - **Class D**: 
     - **Range**: 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255
     - **Used for**: Multicast addresses.
   - **Class E**: 
     - **Range**: 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255
     - **Used for**: Experimental purposes.

2. **Network and Host Separation**:
   - Each class defines a specific number of bits for the network and host portions of the address, impacting how many devices can be connected within a network.

3. **Wasted IP Space**:
   - Classful addressing often resulted in inefficient use of IP addresses, as organizations were forced to use entire class blocks regardless of their actual needs, leading to significant wastage.

4. **Transition to CIDR**:
   - Due to the limitations of classful addressing, CIDR was introduced in the 1990s to provide a more flexible and efficient way to allocate IP addresses, allowing for variable-length subnet masking and better utilization of the available address space.

### Conclusion:
While classful addressing played a crucial role in the early development of the Internet, it has largely been replaced by CIDR, which allows for more scalable and efficient IP address management. Understanding classful addressing remains important for grasping the history and evolution of IP networking.

### What happens if we don't mention /number after IP address, will it be considered as classful?

Yes, if you do not specify a CIDR notation (the `/number`) after an IP address, the addressing will typically default to classful addressing rules based on the first octet of the IP address. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of classful addressing:

### Classful Addressing:

1. **Class A**
   - **Range**: `1.0.0.0` to `126.255.255.255`
   - **Default Subnet Mask**: `255.0.0.0` (or `/8`)
   - **Usable Hosts**: Approximately 16 million addresses.

2. **Class B**
   - **Range**: `128.0.0.0` to `191.255.255.255`
   - **Default Subnet Mask**: `255.255.0.0` (or `/16`)
   - **Usable Hosts**: Approximately 65,000 addresses.

3. **Class C**
   - **Range**: `192.0.0.0` to `223.255.255.255`
   - **Default Subnet Mask**: `255.255.255.0` (or `/24`)
   - **Usable Hosts**: 254 addresses.

4. **Class D (Multicast)**
   - **Range**: `224.0.0.0` to `239.255.255.255`
   - **Used for**: Multicast groups, not assigned a default subnet mask.

5. **Class E (Reserved)**
   - **Range**: `240.0.0.0` to `255.255.255.255`
   - **Used for**: Experimental purposes, not assigned a default subnet mask.

### Important Note on Loopback:

- **Loopback Address**: The range `127.0.0.0` to `127.255.255.255` is reserved for loopback purposes, allowing a device to send and receive data to itself. The most commonly used loopback address is `127.0.0.1`.

### Implications of Classful Addressing:

- **Default Subnet Mask**: When an IP address is provided without a CIDR suffix, the default subnet mask is inferred based on its class:
  - **Class A**: `/8`
  - **Class B**: `/16`
  - **Class C**: `/24`
- **Limited Flexibility**: Classful addressing does not allow for the efficient allocation of IP addresses, leading to wasted IP space. This limitation led to the development of **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)**, which allows for more flexible subnetting.

### Example with Network ID Descriptions:

1. **For the IP address `120.10.90.10`**:
   - Without CIDR notation, it defaults to Class A with a subnet mask of `255.0.0.0` or `/8`.
   - **Network ID**: `120.0.0.0`

2. **For the IP address `172.16.5.10`**:
   - Defaults to Class B with a subnet mask of `255.255.0.0` or `/16`.
   - **Network ID**: `172.16.0.0`

3. **For the IP address `192.168.1.1`**:
   - Defaults to Class C with a subnet mask of `255.255.255.0` or `/24`.
   - **Network ID**: `192.168.1.0`

### Summary for given IP addresses:
- **120.10.90.10**: Class A, Network ID: `120.0.0.0`
- **172.16.5.10**: Class B, Network ID: `172.16.0.0`
- **192.168.1.1**: Class C, Network ID: `192.168.1.0`

This inclusion of network IDs provides a clearer understanding of the network addresses associated with each IP address.

### Note:
- If you do not mention a `/number` after the IP address, the address will follow classful addressing rules based on its leading octet, which determines the default subnet mask. 
- This practice is largely outdated and has been mostly replaced by CIDR, which allows for more efficient and flexible IP address management.

### Key Points:
- Network ID and Network IP terms refer to the address that identifies the network rather than a specific host.
- The use of "network IP" may be more prevalent in discussions about CIDR and modern subnetting techniques, whereas "network ID" might be more commonly heard in discussions about traditional classful addressing.
- Regardless of the terminology used, the essential idea remains the same: the address represents the entire network.
