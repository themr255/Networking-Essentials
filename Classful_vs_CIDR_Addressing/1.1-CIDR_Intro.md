# Fundamentals of CIDR and Subnetting -

### 1. **Understanding CIDR Ranges**:
   - **CIDR Notation**: CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) expresses an IP address along with the number of significant bits that define the network. Example: `192.168.1.0/24`.
     - **Network portion**: The `/24` indicates that the first 24 bits are reserved for the network portion.
     - **Host portion**: The remaining bits (in a 32-bit IPv4 address) are available for host addresses within that network.
   
   - **Flexible Subnetting**: CIDR allows networks to be divided into smaller subnets by adjusting the prefix length (e.g., `/24` can be expanded to `/25`, `/26`, etc.), each with a different number of available host IPs.

### 2. **Dividing Networks (Subnetting)**:
   - **Subnet Masks**: A subnet mask (e.g., `255.255.255.0` for `/24`) is used to separate the network part of the address from the host part. CIDR simplifies this by using the prefix notation (`/24`) instead of writing the full mask.
   
   - **Breaking a Network into Subnets**: For example, starting with a `/24` network (which offers 256 total addresses), you can break it into smaller networks (like `/25`, which provides two subnets of 128 addresses each). Each additional bit added to the prefix length reduces the available host addresses by half.

### 3. **Subnetting with `/ Notation`**:
   - The `/` followed by a number in CIDR notation represents how many bits are used for the network.
   - A smaller number (e.g., `/16`) means more addresses are available for hosts, whereas a larger number (e.g., `/30`) means fewer hosts but more subnets.

### Understanding CIDR:
- CIDR helps organize networks by specifying how much of an IP address is dedicated to the network and how much is for devices.
- The `/notation` tells you how much of the address is locked to define the network vs. how much space is left for devices.

### Key Points:
- Network ID and Network IP terms refer to the address that identifies the network rather than a specific host.
- The use of "network IP" may be more prevalent in discussions about CIDR and modern subnetting techniques, whereas "network ID" might be more commonly heard in discussions about traditional classful addressing.
- Regardless of the terminology used, the essential idea remains the same: the address represents the entire network.
